For more details, see the 2.0-beta-1 Milestone and the full diff . Version 2.0 Alpha 3 (2019-07-04) #1401 LeakCanary can now import all hprof files created from prior LeakCanary versions. #1414 New API: RefWatcher.retainedInstances which returns the instances that are currently considered retained. #1419 New APIs: LeakCanary.Config.maxStoredHeapDumps (default 7) and LeakCanary.Config.requestWriteExternalStoragePermission (default false). LeakCanary won t ask for the external storage permission anymore by default. #1338 API change: LeakCanary.Config.exclusionsFactory replaced with LeakCanary.Config.knownReferences (simpler use), LeakCanary.Config.leakInspectors and LeakCanary.Config.labelers merged into LeakCanary.Config.leakTraceInspectors which provides access to the entire leak trace as well as a new graph oriented API that replaces the low level hprof parser API. #1382 LeakCanary now disables automatic heap dumping when running in AndroidX UI tests. #1424 API rename: RefWatcher.hasRetainedReferences = RefWatcher.hasRetainedInstances , RefWatcher.retainedReferenceCount = RefWatcher.retainedInstanceCount , RefWatcher.hasWatchedReferences = RefWatcher.hasWatchedInstances , RefWatcher.removeKeysRetainedBeforeHeapDump = RefWatcher.removeInstancesRetainedBeforeHeapDump , RefWatcher.clearWatchedReferences = RefWatcher.clearWatchedInstances . #1432 #1438 #1440 New won t fix leaks and leak trace inspectors #1374 #1364 #1366 #1417 #1399 #1416 #1407 #1427 #1385 Bug and crash fixes Many thanks to @1step2hell , @afollestad , @ansman , @bjdodson , @BraisGabin , @EBfVince , @jaredsburrows , @pforhan , @pyricau , @tellypresence , @wiyarmir for the contributions, bug reports and feature requests.

For more details, see the 2.0-alpha-2 Milestone and the full diff . Version 2.0 Alpha 1 (2019-04-23) New logo , thanks @flickator ! Entirely rewritten to 100% Kotlin Multiple leaks detected in one analysis The heap is dumped when the app goes in the background, or when a minimum of 5 leaks is reached in the foreground. Leak grouping Leaks that share similar causes are grouped in the UI. New screens to see the list of groups and each group. Improved leaktrace strings to highlight leak causes. Leaks can be shared to Stack Overflow New library: LeakSentry . Detects when objects are leaking and triggers LeakCanary Can be used independently in production, for instance to report the number of leaking instances on an OutOfMemoryError crash. New heap parser Uses 90% less memory and 6 times faster than the prior heap parser. Runs in the same process as the app on a low priority thread. No more dependency on Perflib and TroveJ. New dependency on Okio. The old parser is still available as leakcanary-android-perflib but will be removed after alpha. Labelers can add any string content to leak elements 0 code setup, just add the one debug dependency. Simpler configuration options Updated from support library to Android X Many thanks to @BraisGabin , @colinmarsch , @jrodbx , @flickator , @JakeWharton , @pyricau , @WhatsEmo for the contributions! For more details, see the 2.0-alpha-1 Milestone and the full diff . Version 1.6.3 (2019-01-10) #1163 Fixed leaks being incorrectly classified as no leak due to missed GC Roots. #1153 LeakCanary.isInAnalyzerProcess now correctly returns true in the analyzer process prior to any first leak (could be triggered by starting the leak result activity). #1158 Stopped enabling DisplayLeakActivity when not using DisplayLeakService. #1135 Fixed IndexOutOfBoundsException for leak traces of size 1. #1163 Keep no leak heap dumps. Many thanks to @KMaragh , @pyricau , @SebRut for the code contributions! For more details, see the 1.6.3 Milestone and the full diff . Version 1.6.2 (2018-10-16) #1067 Fixed TransactionTooLargeException crash (leak analysis would never complete). #1061 Detection of Fragment view leaks after Fragment#onDestroyView(). #1076 Added the FOREGROUND_SERVICE permission for Android P. #1062 The LeakCanary toast now always shows correctly. It doesn t show if there is no activity in foreground. #1115 Reenabled the DisplayLeakActivity icon on fresh installs. #1100 Added nullability annotations to improve Kotlin support. Updates to excluded leaks ( commits ). Updates to reachability inspectors ( commits ). Many thanks to @fractalwrench , @hzsweers , @Goddchen , @igokoro , @IlyaGulya , @JakeWharton , @javmarina , @jokermonn , @jrodbx , @Parseus , @pyricau , @scottkennedy for the code contributions! Public API changes Subclasses of AbstractAnalysisResultService should now override onHeapAnalyzed(@NonNull AnalyzedHeap analyzedHeap) instead of onHeapAnalyzed(@NonNull HeapDump heapDump, @NonNull AnalysisResult result) For more details, see the 1.6.2 Milestone and the full diff . Version 1.6.1 (2018-06-21) #727 Improved leak analysis: LeakCanary now identifies and highlights the potential causes of the leak. #1011 We noticed that computing the retained heap size could take a long time, so it s now optional and off by default. #633 Support for detecting leaks in instrumentation tests ( see the wiki ). #985 Ability to convert leak traces into stack traces for easy remote reporting ( see the wiki ). #983 Support for watching destroyed Fragments. #846 LeakCanary now uses foreground services and displays a notification when the analysis is in progress. This also fixes crashes when analyzing in background on O+. The LeakCanary icon (to start to DisplayLeakActivity) is now hidden by default, and only enabled after the first leak is found. #775 Fixed crash when sharing heap dumps on O+ and added a dependency to the support-core-utils library. #930 DisplayLeakActivity has a responsive icon. #685 Stopped doing IO on main thread in DisplayLeakActivity (fixes StrictMode errors). #999 Updated HAHA to 2.0.4, which uses Trove4j as an external dependency (from jcenter) instead of rebundling it. This is to clarify licences (Apache v2 vs LGPL 2.1). Several bug and crash fixes.

Note: we made a 1.6 release but quickly followed up with 1.6.1 due to #1058 . Public API changes The installed ref watcher singleton is now available via LeakCanary.installedRefWatcher() AnalysisResult.leakTraceAsFakeException() returns an exception that can be used to report and group leak traces to a tool like Bugsnag or Crashlytics. New InstrumentationLeakDetector and FailTestOnLeakRunListener APIs for detecting leaks in instrumentation tests. New Reachability.Inspector and RefWatcherBuilder.stethoscopeClasses() API to establish reachability and help identify leak causes. Watching activities can be disabled with AndroidRefWatcherBuilder.watchActivities(false) , watching fragments can be disabled with AndroidRefWatcherBuilder.watchFragments(false) LeakCanary.setDisplayLeakActivityDirectoryProvider() is deprecated and replaced with LeakCanary.setLeakDirectoryProvider() New RefWatcherBuilder.computeRetainedHeapSize() API to enable the computing of the retained heap size (off by default). For more details, see the 1.6.1 Milestone and the full diff . Version 1.5.4 (2017-09-22) Restore Java 7 compatibility in leakcanary-watcher Version 1.5.3 (2017-09-17) Fix broken 1.5.2 build Convert leakcanary-watcher from Android library to Java library Disable finish animations in RequestStoragePermissionActivity Corrected README sample for Robolectric tests For more details, see the full diff . Version 1.5.2 (2017-08-09) New excluded leaks Move Leakcanary UI into leak analyzer process Ignore computing retained sizes for bitmaps on O+ Add notification channel for persistent messages on O+ Exclude permission activity from recents menu Updated README and sample for handling Robolectric tests For more details, see the full diff . Version 1.5.1 (2017-04-25) New excluded leaks Fix java.util.MissingFormatArgumentException in DisplayLeakService Separate task affinities for different apps Bump minSdk to 14 Fix HahaHelper for O Preview For more details, see the full diff . Version 1.5 (2016-09-28) New excluded leaks Added LeakCanary.isInAnalyzerProcess() to the no-op jar Fixed several file access issues: No more cleanup on startup, we rotate the heap dump files on every new heap dump. LeakCanary now falls back to the app directory until it can write to the external storage. Leak notifications now each use a distinct notification instead of erasing each other. If LeakCanary can t perform a heap dump for any reason (e.g. analysis in progress, debugger attached), it retries later with an exponential backoff. Added confirmation dialog when user deletes all leaks. Replace the two LeakCanary configuration methods with a builder that provides more flexibility, see LeakCanary.refWatcher() . For more details, see the full diff . Public API changes New HeapAnalyzer.findTrackedReferences() method for headless analysis when you have no context on what leaked. Added LeakCanary.isInAnalyzerProcess() to the no-op jar Added LeakCanary.refWatcher() which returns an AndroidRefWatcherBuilder that extends RefWatcherBuilder and lets you fully customize the RefWatcher instance. Removed LeakCanary.install(Application, Class) and LeakCanary.androidWatcher(Context, HeapDump.Listener, ExcludedRefs) . Removed R.integer.leak_canary_max_stored_leaks and R.integer.leak_canary_watch_delay_millis , those can now be set via LeakCanary.refWatcher() . Updated the LeakDirectoryProvider API to centralize all file related responsibilities. RefWatcher is now constructed with a WatchExecutor which executes a Retryable , instead of an Executor that executes a Runnable . HeapDumper.NO_DUMP was renamed HeapDumper.RETRY_LATER Version 1.4 (2016-09-11) Fix false negative where GC root is of type android.os.Binder #482 Update HAHA to 2.0.3; clear compiler warnings #563 Correct some mistakes in German translation #516 Don t loop when storage permission denied #422 Remove old references to __ prefixed resources #477 Fix permission crash for DisplayLeakActivity on M #382 Fix NPE when thread name not found in heap dump #417 Add version info to stacktrace #473 Version 1.4-beta2 (2016-03-23) Add reason for ignoring to analysis result #365 . Lower memory usage when parsing heap dumps on M #223 . Fix NPE in LeakCanaryInternals.isInServiceProcess() #449 . New ignored Android SDK leaks #297 , #322 . Use leakcanary-android-no-op in test builds #143 . Fixes to allow LeakCanary to work with ProGuard #398 . Optimize png assets #406 . Fix delete button not working on error views #408 . Add German translation #437 . Version 1.4-beta1 (2016-01-08) Switched to HAHA 2.0.2 with uses Perflib instead of MAT under the hood #219 . This fixes crashes and improves speed a lot. We can now parse Android M heap dumps #267 , although there are still memory issues (see #223 ). Excluded leaks are now reported as well and available in the display leak activity. Added ProGuard configuration for #132 . Many new ignored Android SDK leaks. Added excluded leaks to text report #119 . Added LeakCanary SHA to text report #120 . Added CanaryLog API to replace the logger: #201 . Renamed all resources to begin with leak_canary_ instead of __leak_canary #161 No crash when heap dump fails #226 . Add retained size to leak reports #162 . Public API changes AnalysisResult.failure is now a Throwable instead of an Exception . Main goal is to catch and correctly report OOMs while parsing. Added ARRAY_ENTRY to LeakTraceElement.Type for references through array entries. Renamed ExcludedRefs fields. Each ExcludedRef entry can now be ignored entirely or kept only if no other path . Added support for ignoring all fields (static and non static) for a given class. Version 1.3.1 (2015-05-16) Heap dumps and analysis results are now saved on the sd card: #21 . ExcludedRef and AndroidExcludedRefs are customizable: #12 #73 . 7 new ignored Android SDK leaks: #1 #4 #32 #89 #82 #97 . Fixed 3 crashes in LeakCanary: #37 #46 #66 . Fixed StrictMode thread policy violations: #15 . Updated minSdkVersion from 9 to 8 : #57 . Added LeakCanary version name to LeakCanary.leakInfo() : #49 . leakcanary-android-no-op is lighter, it does not depend on leakcanary-watcher anymore, only 2 classes now: #74 . Adding field state details to the text leak trace. A Toast is displayed while the heap dump is in progress to warn that the UI will freeze: #20 . You can customize the toast by providing your own layout named __leak_canary_heap_dump_toast.xml (e.g. you could make it an empty layout). If the analysis fails, the result and heap dump are kept so that it can be reported to LeakCanary: #102 . Update to HAHA 1.3 to fix a 2 crashes #3 46 Public API changes When upgrading from 1.3 to 1.3.1, previously saved heap dumps will not be readable any more, but they won t be removed from the app directory. You should probably uninstall your app. Added android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE to leakcanary-android artifact. LeakCanary.androidWatcher() parameter types have changed (+ExcludedRefs). LeakCanary.leakInfo() parameter types have changed (+boolean) ExcludedRef is now serializable and immutable, instances can be created using ExcludedRef.Builder . ExcludedRef is available in HeapDump AndroidExcludedRefs is an enum, you can now pick the leaks you want to ignore in AndroidExcludedRefs by creating an EnumSet and calling AndroidExcludedRefs.createBuilder() . AndroidExcludedRefs.createAppDefaults() AndroidExcludedRefs.createAndroidDefaults() return a ExcludedRef.Builder . ExcludedRef moved from leakcanary-analyzer to leakcanary-watcher Version 1.3 (2015-05-08) Initial release.

In a Java based runtime, a memory leak is a programming error that causes an application to keep a reference to an object that is no longer needed. As a result, the memory allocated for that object cannot be reclaimed, eventually leading to an OutOfMemoryError crash. For example, an Android activity instance is no longer needed after its onDestroy() method is called, and storing a reference to that activity in a static field would prevent it from being garbage collected. Common causes for memory leaks Most memory leaks are caused by bugs related to the lifecycle of objects. Here are a few common Android mistakes: Storing an Activity context as a field in an object that survives activity recreation due to configuration changes. Registering a listener, broadcast receiver or RxJava subscription which references an object with lifecycle, and forgetting to unregister when the lifecycle reaches its end. Storing a view in a static field, and not clearing that field when the view is detached. Why should I use LeakCanary? Memory leaks are very common in Android apps. OutOfMemoryError (OOM) is the top crash for most apps on the play store, however that s usually not counted correctly. When memory is low the OOM can be thrown from anywhere in your code, which means every OOM has a different stacktrace and they re counted as different crashes. When we first enabled LeakCanary in the Square Point Of Sale app, we were able to find and fix several leaks and reduced the OutOfMemoryError crash rate by 94% . How does LeakCanary work? Detecting retained instances The foundation of LeakCanary is a library called ObjectWatcher Android. It hooks into the Android lifecycle to automatically detect when activities and fragments are destroyed and should be garbage collected. These destroyed instances are passed to an ObjectWatcher , which holds weak references to them. You can also watch any instance that is no longer needed, for example a detached view, a destroyed presenter, etc. If the weak references aren t cleared after waiting 5 seconds and running the garbage collector, the watched instances are considered retained , and potentially leaking. Dumping the heap When the number of retained instances reaches a threshold, LeakCanary dumps the Java heap into a .hprof file stored onto the Android file system. The default threshold is 5 retained instances when the app is visible, and 1 retained instance when the app is not visible. Analyzing the heap LeakCanary parses the .hprof file using Shark and finds the chain of references that prevents retained instances from being garbage collected: the leak trace . Leak trace is another name for the shortest strong reference path from garbage collection roots to a retained object . Once the leak trace is determined, LeakCanary uses its built-in knowledge of the Android framework to deduct which instances in the leak trace are leaking (see below How do I fix a memory leak? ). Grouping leaks Using the leak status information, LeakCanary narrows down the reference chain to a sub chain of possible leak causes, and displays the result. Leaks that have the same causal chain are considered to be the same leak, so leaks are grouped by identical sub chain. How do I fix a memory leak? For each leaking instance, LeakCanary computes a leak trace and displays it in its UI: The leak trace is also logged to Logcat: \u252c \u251c\u2500 leakcanary.internal.InternalLeakCanary \u2502 Leaking: NO (it s a GC root and a class is never leaking) \u2502 \u2193 static InternalLeakCanary.application \u251c\u2500 com.example.leakcanary.ExampleApplication \u2502 Leaking: NO (Application is a singleton) \u2502 \u2193 ExampleApplication.leakedViews \u2502 ~~~~~~~~~~~ \u251c\u2500 java.util.ArrayList \u2502 Leaking: UNKNOWN \u2502 \u2193 ArrayList.elementData \u2502 ~~~~~~~~~~~ \u251c\u2500 java.lang.Object[] \u2502 Leaking: UNKNOWN \u2502 \u2193 array Object[].[0] \u2502 ~~~ \u251c\u2500 android.widget.TextView \u2502 Leaking: YES (View detached and has parent) \u2502 View#mAttachInfo is null (view detached) \u2502 View#mParent is set \u2502 View.mWindowAttachCount=1 \u2502 \u2193 TextView.mContext \u2570\u2192 com.example.leakcanary.MainActivity \u200b Leaking: YES (RefWatcher was watching this and MainActivity#mDestroyed is true) Objects and references \u251c\u2500 android.widget.TextView Each node in the leak trace is a Java object and is either a class, an object array or an instance. \u2502 \u2193 TextView.mContext Going down, each node has a reference to the next node. In the UI, that reference is in purple . In the Logcat representation, the reference is on the line that starts with a down arrow. GC Root \u252c \u251c\u2500 leakcanary.internal.InternalLeakCanary \u2502 Leaking: NO (it s a GC root and a class is never leaking) At the top of the leak trace is a garbage-collection (GC) root. GC roots are special objects that are always reachable. There are four kinds of GC roots worth mentioning: Local variables , which belong to the stack of a thread. Instances of active Java threads . Classes , which never unload on Android. Native references , which are controlled by native code. Leaking instance \u2570\u2192 com.example.leakcanary.MainActivity \u200b Leaking: YES (RefWatcher was watching this and MainActivity#mDestroyed is true) At the bottom of the leak trace is the leaking instance. This instance was passed to AppWatcher.objectWatcher to confirm it would be garbage collected, and it ended up not being garbage collected which triggered LeakCanary. Chain of references ... \u2502 \u2193 static InternalLeakCanary.application ... \u2502 \u2193 ExampleApplication.leakedViews ... \u2502 \u2193 ArrayList.elementData ... \u2502 \u2193 array Object[].[0] ... \u2502 \u2193 TextView.mContext ... The chain of references from the GC root to the leaking instance is what is preventing the leaking instance from being garbage collected. If you can identify the reference that should not exist at that point in time, then you can figure out why it s incorrectly still set and then fix the memory leak. Heuristics and labels \u251c\u2500 android.widget.TextView \u2502 Leaking: YES (View detached and has parent) \u2502 View#mAttachInfo is null (view detached) \u2502 View#mParent is set \u2502 View.mWindowAttachCount=1 LeakCanary runs heuristics to determine the lifecycle state of the nodes of the leak trace, and therefore whether they are leaking or not. For example, if a view has View#mAttachInfo = null and mParent != null then it is detached yet has a parent, so that view is probably leaking. In the leak trace, for each node you ll see Leaking: YES / NO / UNKNOWN with an explanation in parenthesis. LeakCanary can also surface extra information about the state of a node, e.g. View.mWindowAttachCount=1 . LeakCanary comes with a set of default heuristics: AndroidObjectInspectors .

Similarly, if a node is leaking then any node down the leak trace is also leaking. From that, we can deduce that the leak is caused by a reference that is after the last Leaking: NO and before the first Leaking: YES . LeakCanary highlights those references with a red underline in the UI, or a ~~~~ underline in the Logcat representation. These highlighted references are the only possible causes of the leak . These are the references you should spend time investigating. In this example, the last Leaking: NO is on com.example.leakcanary.ExampleApplication and the first Leaking: YES is on android.widget.TextView , so the leak is caused by one of the 3 references in between: ... \u2502 \u2193 ExampleApplication.leakedViews \u2502 ~~~~~~~~~~~ ... \u2502 \u2193 ArrayList.elementData \u2502 ~~~~~~~~~~~ ... \u2502 \u2193 array Object[].[0] \u2502 ~~~ ... Looking at the source , we can see that ExampleApplication has a list field: open class ExampleApplication : Application() { val leakedViews = mutableListOf View () } It s unlikely that there s a bug in the ArrayList implementation itself, so the leak happens because we re adding views to ExampleApplication.leakedViews . If we stop doing that, we ve fixed the leak! Asking for help with a leak If you cannot figure out a leak, please do not file an issue .

If you have compile errors, see below. Question : if there s no no-op anymore, how do I ensure none of this runs during release builds? Answer : as long as you add leakcanary-android as debugImplementation , there won t be any code referencing LeakCanary in your release builds. LeakCanary does not depend on the support library anymore, and it doesn t depend on AndroidX either. Detection of AndroidX fragments is automatic if you have the AndroidX fragments dependency.

It will not trigger heap dumps or anything else that LeakCanary does. It s very little code and should have a no impact on your release app. You can use it to count how many objects are retained, for example to add metadata to OutOfMemoryError crashes: val retainedObjectCount = AppWatcher . objectWatcher . retainedObjectCount Option 2: Make your own ObjectWatcher interface // In shared code interface MaybeObjectWatcher { fun watch ( watchedObject : Any ) object None : MaybeObjectWatcher { override fun watch ( watchedObject : Any ) { } } } // In debug code class RealObjectWatcher : MaybeObjectWatcher { override fun watch ( watchedObject : Any ) { AppWatcher . objectWatcher . watch ( watchedObject ) } } Use MaybeObjectWatcher.None in release code and RealObjectWatcher in debug code.

AndroidReferenceMatchers AndroidReferenceMatchers values add ReferenceMatcher instances to a global list via their add method. A ReferenceMatcher is either a IgnoredReferenceMatcher or a LibraryLeakReferenceMatcher . AndroidReferenceMatchers is used to build the list of known references that cannot ever create leaks (via IgnoredReferenceMatcher ) as well as the list of known leaks in the Android Framework and in manufacturer specific Android implementations. This class is a work in progress. You can help by reporting leak traces that seem to be caused by the Android SDK, here: https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/new We filter on SDK versions and Manufacturers because many of those leaks are specific to a given manufacturer implementation, they usually share their builds across multiple models, and the leaks eventually get fixed in newer versions. Most app developers should use appDefaults . However, you can also use a subset of AndroidReferenceMatchers by creating an EnumSet that matches your needs and calling buildKnownReferences .
